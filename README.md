#HR Analytics Dashboard 

#Business Question: 
   Why is the company’s attrition rate increasing, and how can it be reduced?
   This dashboard is built to analyze the rising attrition rates within the organization, identify the underlying factors contributing to employee turnover, and provide actionable insights to improve retention.

#Key Dimensions/Measures:
    The key dimensions and measures used in the dashboard are:
    •	Employee Demographics: Age, Gender, Department, Job Role
	  •	Employee Performance: Performance Rating, Promotions
	  •	Compensation: Salary, Pay Grade
	  •	Job Satisfaction: Satisfaction Score, Feedback Ratings
	  •	Tenure: Years at the Company, Employment Type
	  •	Attrition: Status (Attrition or Active), Exit Reasons
	  •	Work Environment: Workload, Work-Life Balance, Manager Support.

#Key Insights:
   The dashboard provides insights into why employees are leaving the company and what improvements can be made to reduce the attrition rate:
	•	Attrition Rate by Department: This insight identifies which departments have the highest turnover. For example, high attrition in the sales department might indicate issues related to job satisfaction or 
    workload.
	•	Job Satisfaction and Attrition Correlation: A correlation analysis shows how low satisfaction scores correlate with high turnover rates, especially in specific departments or job roles.
	•	Performance vs. Attrition: Employees with consistently lower performance ratings are more likely to leave, indicating that poor performers either voluntarily leave or are let go, but high-performing employees
    leaving may indicate dissatisfaction.
	•	Compensation and Retention: A salary distribution analysis shows whether employees in lower pay grades or those receiving below-average compensation are more likely to leave.
	•	Tenure and Attrition Trends: Employees who have been with the company for 1-2 years show a higher propensity to leave. This insight helps HR focus on retention strategies for newer employees.

#Process Involved:
   Step 1: Data Collection
   Data was gathered from the company’s HR information system (HRIS), including employee demographics, performance data, satisfaction surveys, and compensation details. Attrition data (whether an employee left
   or stayed) was also extracted.
   Step 2: Data Cleaning
   The dataset was cleaned to remove duplicate records, fill missing values, and standardize data types. Outliers in satisfaction scores and salary data were addressed to ensure accurate insights.
   Step 3: Feature Engineering
   New features were created, such as:
   	•	Tenure Group: Categorizing employees based on years of service (e.g., 0-1 year, 1-3 years).
	  •	Attrition Status: Adding a binary column to identify whether an employee is still with the company or has left.
	  •	Job Satisfaction Categories: Grouping satisfaction scores into high, medium, and low categories.
  Step 4: Data Modeling
  Key metrics such as attrition rate, average salary, and performance ratings were calculated. The correlation between job satisfaction and attrition, as well as compensation and attrition, was modeled to
  identify significant factors.
  Step 5: Visualization in Power BI
  The data was visualized using Power BI, with interactive charts and KPIs to explore key metrics:
    •	Attrition rate by department and job role.
  	•	Satisfaction and performance visualizations to highlight patterns.
  	•	Salary analysis to compare compensation across departments.
	  •	Filters and slicers to allow users to view data by specific departments, job roles, or demographic groups.
 Step 6: Insights and Actionable Recommendations
 After the dashboard was built, insights were interpreted, and key recommendations were formulated, such as improving employee satisfaction programs, revising compensation strategies, and developing targeted
 retention efforts for high-risk groups (e.g., those with lower satisfaction scores or in high-attrition departments).

#Conclusion:
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a clear understanding of why the company’s attrition rate is increasing. By focusing on key factors such as job satisfaction, performance, and compensation, the dashboard
helps HR teams develop targeted retention strategies to reduce employee turnover and improve overall workforce satisfaction.
